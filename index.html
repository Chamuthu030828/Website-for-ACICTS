                                        <p class="card-text">It was the early 80’s. A time when the term “ICT” was something new to Sri Lankan
                                            mind. A group of courageous Anandians stepped up together and formed the “Ananda
                                            College Computer Society”. With the advent of time, this society became a pioneer
                                            in the school computing arena. Time Passed. By the start of the 21st century,
                                            the society was nearly abandoned until a group of skillful Anandians with determination
                                            took the initiative on reviving the society back to its glory days. Like a Phoenix
                                            border-top-right-radiussing from the ashes, the society was reborn as the Ananda
                                            College Information and Communication Technology Society. Completely rejuvenated;
                                            the society started its journey to accomplish the goal of revolutionizing the
                                            school-based ICT of Sri Lanka. Hosting mammoth events such as “Pulz” in 2006,
                                            2007, 2010 and 2011, Creating and Managing one of the best school websites and
                                            keeping it up-to-date are some of the many accomplishments of ACICTS. By being
                                            the pioneer of the ICT related activities throughout the school, and providing
                                            technical and other assistance to almost all the events held by the school. ACICTS
                                            has become a well-known society inside Ananda College. And taking a step beyond
                                            contemporary school based ICT societies’, ACICTS has also been providing IT requirements
                                            for events and for the projects done outside the school as well. Through hard
                                            work and commitment ACICTS has become the most renowned ICT society in the country
                                            by gaining consecutive victories and titles in all the fields of ICT in both
                                            the Local and Global Arena. The Society has also given birth to some of the most
                                            renowned graphic designers, programmers, web developers, who dominate the ICT
                                            field of the country at the moment. The Annual ICT event, organized by ACICTS
                                            is not only the most anticipated school-based ICT event, it has become one of
                                            the most iconic events belonging the whole ICT arena in Sri Lanka. Each year
                                            ACICTS evolves Pulz in a colossal magnitude, breaking the standards of the last
                                            year. SNICT is also one of the massive ideas initiated and implemented by ACICTS.
                                            This is the premier school-based ICT community of the country. Joining hands
                                            with IT societies throughout the country, working in harmony towards lessening
                                            the digital divide. Today, we are proud to say that ACICTS has achieved a status
                                            in the ICT field and we are Unrivaled, Unparalleled and Unmatched by any ICT
                                            society in the Island, and our goal is to bring Pride and glory to our Alma Mater
                                            through the Cyberspace and the Digital World.</p>
